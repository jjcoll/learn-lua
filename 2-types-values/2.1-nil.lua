--[[
Nil is a type with a single value, nil, whose main property is to be different from any other value. 
As we have seen, a global variable has a nil value by default, 
before a first assignment, and you can assign nil to a global variable to delete it. Lua uses nil as
a kind of non-value, to represent the absence of a useful value.
