The userdata type allows arbitrary C data to be stored in Lua variables. It has no predefined operations in Lua, except
assignment and equality test. Userdata are used to represent new types created by an application program or a library 
written in C; for instance, the standard I/O librarry uses them to represent files. We will discuss more about
userdata later, when we get to the C API.

We will explain the thread type in Chapter 9, where we discuss coroutines
