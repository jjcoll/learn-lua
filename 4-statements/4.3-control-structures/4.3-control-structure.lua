-- lua provides a small and conventional set of control structures, with if for conditional and while, repeat and for
-- for iteration. All control structures have an explicit terminator: end
--  - terminates the if, for, while structures; and until terminates the repeat structure


-- The condition expression of a control structure may result in any value. Lua treats as true all values
-- different from nil and false
